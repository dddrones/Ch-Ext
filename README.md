# Plant Friend: A Chome Extension

This extension ended up being a popup with buttons that control one of three plants from sitting on your
screen. You can have many plants, continuing to click can fill the page with layers upon layers of succulents, strawberries, and flowers. 

The intention was to have them stay on screen and change over time, but the commands needed proved
to be more difficult than anticipated. Unfortunately I did not reach my goal, but I want to return to this idea when I figure out how to fix the issues I faced.

I drew inspiration from desktop buddies, and although I wasn't able to reach the full potential of my
idea, i think it works as a little plant friend to add to (almost) any page.
